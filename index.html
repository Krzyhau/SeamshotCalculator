        <p>
            Ray collision detection with brushes in Source-based games have a bug 
            allowing you to shoot through some of the seams. We call them <b>seamshots</b>
            (more info on that <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.portal2.sr/Seamshot">here</a>.) 
            This little tool of mine was created to find these seams in any given 
            Portal 2 BSP map, and give you a list of <code>sar_drawline</code> commands 
            in a config file which you can execute in game to see all of the seams. 
            False positives are undoubtedly certain, and colors make absolutely no sense, 
            but it's enough for me so heck it, releasing the tool so maybe someone else 
            can fix it for me lol.
